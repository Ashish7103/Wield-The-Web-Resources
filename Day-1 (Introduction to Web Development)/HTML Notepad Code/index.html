<!-- Explantaion:
Here <html> denotes starting of HTML code and </html> denotes ending of HTML code. 
All things written in between is part of HTML document.

<h1>tag is used as primary heading tag. -->


<!-- NOTE:
Why no meta tags are used here?
Meta tags are basically used when you have to host a website and it helps in SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) for
better ranking of your webpage on search engine.

But here this code is written to just show behaviour of html code and we weren't going to host it So meta tags weren't necessary.
But it's a good practice to use Meta tags.


Why no Title tags are used here.
It is advisable to write Title and Body tag in HTML code but it is skipped here to just show how HTMl behave. -->
